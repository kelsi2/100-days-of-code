### 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* Chapter 6 of Eloquent JavaScript (The Secret Life of Objects) -- which means I get to tackle my first project in this book tomorrow!
* freeCodeCamp Javascript certification: debugging

**Thoughts:** 
I'm pretty new to coding and finding reading through Eloquent JavaScript to be tough but rewarding. It's teaching me a lot about how code works behind the scenes.

### Day 2: Saturday August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* freeCodeCamp Javascript certification: Basic Data Structures

**Thoughts:**
Not as much time to work on coding today as I hoped so didn't end up getting to my project, but I'm proud that I got something done all the same!

### Day 3: Sunday August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* Worked through Eloquent JavaScript project 1: A Robot
* Started work on freeCodeCamp JavaScript algorithms

**Thoughts:**
The algorithms are great practice for job interviews. I enjoyed working through the project, however, it seems difficult to save the code from something like that since most of it is part of the book and the rest of the project won't work without using that.

### Day 4: Monday August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* Finished freeCodeCamp JavaScript basic algorithms
* freeCodeCamp JavaScript Object Oriented Programming Challenges

**Thoughts:**
Definitely finding the algorithms a little bit tricky, but worth the practice for sure. I spent a lot of time today setting up this repository and log, glad to have it up and running now!

### Day 5: Tuesday August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* Attended a Meetup about building a website using HTML and CSS
* Set up my website using GitHub Pages
* Began the tutorial to set up Jekyll

**Thoughts:**
Jekyll seems tricky but I'm getting used to it! Exciting stuff setting up my first website! :D

### Day 6: Wednesday August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

* Worked on intermediate algorithms on freeCodeCamp
* Completed Jekyll tutorial and decided not to use it for my website

**Thoughts:**
Looking forward to really starting on my website! I decided not to use Jekyll because the plugins don't operate on GitHub Pages without using a workaround so I'd rather use another tool. Algorithms take a lot of work but as mentioned are great practice.
